### Important!

The pictures above show the build composed with the help of [www.pcbuilder.com](http://www.pcbuilder.com). The total here is $514.91, not $580, because the Crucial P5 500GB M.2 SSD had no price listed. According to the official manufacturer website, the price of the component is $64.99 ([https://www.crucial.com/ssd/p5-plus/ct500p5pssd8](https://www.crucial.com/ssd/p5-plus/ct500p5pssd8)).

Furthermore, the website warns us about a BIOS/UEFI compatibility issue between the CPU and the motherboard. This issue is related to the version of the motherboard’s firmware (BIOS/UEFI). From what I have seen, this issue was resolved in 2021. However, if the motherboard’s firmware is out of date, it can be updated without a CPU, as the chosen motherboard features a BIOS flash button directly on the board.
