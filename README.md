# CompTIA A+ PC Assembly Simulation

Here you’ll find a collection of **PC builds** tailored for different use cases — from business setups to general-purpose systems. Each build is designed with **cost, performance, and reliability** in mind.

The reasoning behind each component choice, along with detailed explanations and assembly steps, can be found in the **documentation**.

## Purpose

This repository aims to help to help me better understand **PC building fundamentals** through practical, scenario-based examples aligned with **CompTIA A+ concepts**.
